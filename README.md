# UML-Alerts
UML-Alerts is a SMS based alert app. Users of the app are able to set a
message to be sent to a list of contact(s) via SMS messaging. Location based
tracking is enabled by default - anytime the app is open, it keeps track
of the user's location and records it for use in sending the alert. The
location is used in the alert - when sending the text message, a Google Maps
URL is added to the bottom of the message with the user's Lat/Long coordinates.
Every alert that is sent also has its date and location recorded to the
internal memory of the user's phone, which is then displayed on a Google Maps
view in the app to show the user where their previous alerts have taken place
and at what time.

This app was originally created by Jason Downing and Udit Bhansali for an
Android Development course at UMass Lowell.
